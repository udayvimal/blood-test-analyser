ü©∫ Blood Test Report Analyser (CrewAI + FastAPI)

This project provides an API to analyse uploaded blood test reports (PDFs) and return a structured, evidence-informed summary with next steps. It uses FastAPI for serving endpoints, CrewAI for orchestration, and LangChain tools for reading PDF data.
 üêõ Bug Fix Log

Here‚Äôs a structured log of all bugs found and how they were fixed.

1. main.py

BUG: asyncio imported but unused.
FIX: Removed to keep code clean.

BUG: kickoff({'query': query}) did not pass file_path, breaking tasks needing {file_path}.
FIX: kickoff({'query': query, 'file_path': file_path}).

BUG: No validation for uploaded file type.
FIX: Added check to ensure only PDF files are accepted, else HTTPException(400).

BUG: Entire file read into memory at once.
FIX: Streamed upload to disk in 1MB chunks.

BUG: Query default check was loose (if query == "" or query is None).
FIX: Normalized with (query or "").strip() or "Summarise my Blood Test Report".

BUG: 500 error messages hid underlying issue.
FIX: Included str(e) in HTTPException detail for better debugging.

2. agents.py

BUG: Wrong import path: from crewai.agents import Agent.
FIX: from crewai import Agent.

BUG: llm = llm (undefined variable).
FIX: Instantiated ChatOpenAI with OPENAI_MODEL from .env.

BUG: Used tool=[...] instead of tools=[...].
FIX: Corrected to tools=[BloodTestReportTool()].

BUG: Passed unsupported args (memory, max_iter, max_rpm) to Agent.
FIX: Removed for CrewAI v0.28 compatibility.

BUG: Prompts encouraged unsafe/fabricated medical advice.
FIX: Rewrote goals/backstories to provide safe, evidence-based outputs with disclaimers.

3. task.py

BUG: tools=[BloodTestReportTool.read_data_tool] passed a method, not a tool instance.
FIX: Instantiated tool:

blood_report_tool = BloodTestReportTool()
tools=[blood_report_tool]


BUG: Verification task used doctor agent.
FIX: Assigned to verifier.

BUG: Tasks ignored {file_path}, making file input useless.
FIX: Added {file_path} placeholder in all descriptions.

BUG: Prompts encouraged fake URLs, contradictions, unsafe plans.
FIX: Rewrote task descriptions + expected outputs to structured, safe formats.

BUG: Unused import search_tool.
FIX: Removed.

4. tools.py

BUG: Wrong import: from crewai_tools import tools.
FIX: Correct import:

from crewai_tools.tools import BaseTool
from crewai_tools.tools.serper_dev_tool import SerperDevTool


BUG: PDFLoader referenced but never imported.
FIX: Imported PyPDFLoader from langchain_community.document_loaders.

BUG: BloodTestReportTool was a plain class with async method (read_data_tool), not CrewAI-compatible.
FIX: Subclassed BaseTool, implemented _run(self, path).

BUG: No check for file existence or type.
FIX: Added os.path.exists + extension check.

BUG: Whitespace handling weak (only replaced \n\n).
FIX: Collapsed multiple spaces/newlines, cleaned text properly.

BUG: Could return empty text for scanned PDFs.
FIX: Added guard: return helpful OCR message if no text extracted.

BUG: NutritionTool/ExerciseTool async methods not CrewAI-compatible.
FIX: Converted to BaseTool subclasses with _run stubs.
